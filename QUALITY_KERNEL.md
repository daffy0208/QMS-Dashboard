# QUALITY KERNEL — INIT OVERRIDE

When `/init` is run in this project:

1. Do NOT generate application code.
2. Read `intake-rules.md` first.
3. Run the quality intake before asking about implementation.
4. Determine risk class and rigor.
5. Generate required quality artefacts before any build steps.
6. No artefact may be skipped without an explicit deviation record.
